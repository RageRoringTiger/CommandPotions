# CommandPotions
**Created by RageRoringTiger**


## Main Info
This plugin let's you create potions that when they are drank by a player, run command(s). Then after a certain amount of time, the potion will run out and more command(s) will be run. During the time the potion is active specified particles will spawn around the player. This is all done through the config.

## Commands
There are only 2 commands you need to know:
* /cpot <potion-name> <player> 
  * If <player> is not set, then the potion will be given to the command sender (player who typed the command).
* /cpot reload
  * Reload the plugin config.

## Configuration
All of the plugin configuration is done through a simple config:

Format: ![Alt Text](url)

## Permissions
To spawn in a potion a player need the permission *commandpotions.createpotion*. **Any** player can drink a potion to run commands.
